It shouldn't be surprising to hear, that as a high-er profile Indie title, there's a PS4 version and the game is built with Unity. Undoubtedly, the visuals sing brighter than many Unity games achieve (Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak looked very "Unity", perhaps because comparison with its brother and sister are easy), with a colour palette that makes the world shine with strong bright colours, crisp shadows and warm light. As the sun shifts across the landscape, while mist traces along a cold creek in the early morning, there's much to celebrate in the game art, and nature itself.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="4" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title title-size-large p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-center  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="69"><div class="Component ls-fx-r p-1 " data-reactid="70"><div class="Group Group--heading p-1 fx-2" data-reactid="71"><div class="System-font  Headline" data-reactid="72"><h1 data-reactid="73"><span class="" data-reactid="74"><a class="font-title" data-reactid="75">Code Name: STEAM (2015)</a></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 76 --><!-- react-empty: 77 --><!-- react-empty: 78 --></div><div class="Group Group--textual p-1 fx-1" data-reactid="79"><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="80"><p>As is a tendency of anyone when attempting to describe a videogame, and to give it life through words, we tend to make parallels. The pedigree behind STEAM includes Advance Wars and Fire Emblem, and the chessboard like structure to the strategy world clearly mirrors that heritage. In addition, we have a heavy dose of Valkyria Chronicles, both in terms of hypothetically historic settings and those glorious cell shaded visuals that help the titles sing, rendered in a reality of their own making. But there's more. Your foes are a set of aliens and your weapons and the worlds are powered by some kind of elaborate Steampunk (hence the name) and the story bubbles along like an exaggerated 60s American comic.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="81"><p>So, with that muddle of gameplay ideas, you start to get an inkling of the kind of game we have here. Heavily leaning on the tight strategic gameplay, these myriadinspirations don't feel as unruly as may have been the case from a less talented team. The tight levels are littered with collectable items for unlocking new equipment and perks for your character. Your arsenal is rapidly expanded to give you an expanding set of options to approach each challenge. Enemy types are also switched up regularly, meaning you're often being asked to find solutions and tactics that work in each instance. There's certainly some weapons and characters you lean on more than others, and the special moves (available once for each sortie, but requiring no "action points" to work) but the balance of your team is of utmost importance. Keeping the squad tightly arranged while making gambles on progress against care is filled with satisfaction, and after an unduly steep learning curve replete with deaths, I was soon seeing this as more well balanced than the first hours suggest.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="5" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title title-size-medium p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-center  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="82"><div class="Component fx-c a-i-center p-1 " data-reactid="83"><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 max-w-768px m-a" data-reactid="84"><!-- react-empty: 85 --><!-- react-empty: 86 --><div class="System-font  Headline" data-reactid="87"><h1 data-reactid="88"><span class="" data-reactid="89"><a class="font-title" data-reactid="90">Whiplash - 2014</a></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 91 --><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="92"><p>A film about Jazz doesn't jump to the top of many people's lists of must see films.

My issue is that the art is easily lost by loud noises and a big bag of repetitive tricks. Winning attention through fear is almost a dead cert. That's how the news works too. But making something universally beautiful and poetic is tough. Genre defining pieces like Alien walk the line well of building atmosphere alongside a cohesive world, rather than just exploiting existing audience fears. The Witch too, falls into this thoughtful category. And it has more than a few tricks up its sleeve.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="7" class="Section Section--components-1 title-size-large color-title text-align-center d-b p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-center  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="126"><div class="Component p-1 " data-reactid="127"><div class="Group Group--heading p-1 m-a" data-reactid="128"><div class="System-font m-a Headline" data-reactid="129"><h1 data-reactid="130"><span class="" data-reactid="131"><a class="font-title" data-reactid="132">Ant-Man (2015)</a></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 133 --></div><!-- react-empty: 134 --><div class="Group Group--textual p-1 ls-t-a-j col-2 col-gap-s m-a" data-reactid="135"><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="136"><p>It is interesting, seeing a film and getting the feeling it wasn't meant to be. Not in terms of its quality or a stroke of luck from fate. With Ant-Man, we have a full on mockery of every super hero trope there is, wrapped in the narrative of a classic comic book film. From the outset, let's be clear and highlight that the film pulls plenty of punches. Especially early on, this is ticking a list of check boxes with almost indifference. We meet the hero (Stan) and meet his family, finding both his opportunity for redemption and his reason to fight the powers of evil… or rather to rob the rich. </p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="137"><p>But Edgar Wright's script is bubbling under the surface, and there are some sequences with rapid monologues and snappy editing that feel like they're floating out of those VHS box sets of spaced sitting on the shelf.

It was 1991, and the world wasn't sure what the 90's would be yet. Tape records, a heavy focus on the radio and newspapers, and a soundtrack that certainly plucks a little harder at the minds distant memories than one would like to admit, all stand together to make it clear, you are watching an old film of yester year and times have changed. It's interesting then, when originality can flow so easily and readily from a Hollywood piece. Robin Williams and Jeff Bridges are both well-established actors by this time, and it's hardly Terry Gilliam's first film. But you can't imagine a more appropriately cast and well thought through alternative romp. </p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="149"><p>There's the sprinkling of swearing and violence that stops The Fisher King from being a family movie… and the pace is completely off, throwing out the "age rating to draw a crowd". Both are conscious decisions that Hollywood would be loath to make with a cast of such prestigious billing anytime since and - while it would be foolhardy to suggest that the results are a resoundingly coherent accomplishment - there's a charm that pulls you in more effectively than an MTV rate of editing is normally able to. Gilliam makes himself known, with his off kilter cinematography, as it swirls and bobs over people's faces, making wonderfully off putting representations of the alcohol ailed mind. There's plenty of flavour, regardless if it is to everyone's taste.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="9" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title title-size-medium p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-center  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="150"><div class="Component fx-c a-i-center p-1 " data-reactid="151"><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 max-w-768px m-a" data-reactid="152"><!-- react-empty: 153 --><!-- react-empty: 154 --><!-- react-empty: 155 --><!-- react-empty: 156 --><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="157"><p>As time marches on, the meaning and value of Steve Jobs continues to shift. Now part of legend, popular culture has started to echo the back lash against Steve for headlining the credits of multiple devices - that owed more to those around him than Jobs himself. All the while, main stream media continues to try to digest this realist view of the man, along with the IT rock star image that it built around him. Though harder to make a visual connection between Steve and Fassbender, this latest effort, is undoubtedly a more successful film than the other recent namesake "Jobs" 2013. In fact, that lack of "cosmetic puppetry" assists the film's earnestness as a character piece - questioning motive and art all the while...

The back stage iconography, immaculate presentation of period dress and (most importantly) a keen focus on human interaction as dialogue exchanges all serves to further reinforce the stage script interpretation. But to me, Danny Boyle's treatment of time and editing (almost the only detail to strongly suggest his presence in the production) sell the latest feature as a motion picture in its own right, rather than as an extension to the man's biography.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="11" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title color-bg section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0 text-align-center group-order-normal  colors-black colors-local " data-reactid="159"><div class="Component ls-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="160"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-66p w-100p ls-w-66p" data-reactid="161"><a href="http://asianmoviepulse.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/post/parasyte-part-1-2014-review/shinichi-migi-parasyte1.jpg" class="" data-reactid="162"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="163"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="164"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/ea603efca06f956fd2bca7d7e9b13d12/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fbd570d06661351e714728a28ecdfa62e048db2eb.jpg&amp;width=1440" style="object-position:45.730461085676914% 41.41119462025317%;" data-reactid="165"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/c5330a6c492f7ec8d8de22d6c850a365/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fbd570d06661351e714728a28ecdfa62e048db2eb.jpg&amp;width=1280" style="object-position:45.730461085676914% 41.41119462025317%;" data-reactid="166"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/9c73dedc961c009a838ed4822228090f/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fbd570d06661351e714728a28ecdfa62e048db2eb.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:45.730461085676914% 41.41119462025317%;" data-reactid="167"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/65e5d99b73f6f8c037dcac22710d3a5f/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fbd570d06661351e714728a28ecdfa62e048db2eb.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:45.730461085676914% 41.41119462025317%;" data-reactid="168"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="1529" data-height="632" data-ratio="2.4193037974683542" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/ea603efca06f956fd2bca7d7e9b13d12/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fbd570d06661351e714728a28ecdfa62e048db2eb.jpg&amp;width=1440" style="object-position:45.730461085676914% 41.41119462025317%;" data-reactid="169"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-2 ls-p-h-5 ls-p-v-8 fx-b-33p color-title" data-reactid="170"><!-- react-empty: 171 --><!-- react-empty: 172 --><!-- react-empty: 173 --><div class="Attribution op-60 " data-reactid="174"><h5 data-reactid="175"><span class="Author f-s-xxs " data-reactid="176"><a href="http://asianmoviepulse.com">asianmoviepulse.com</a></span></h5></div><!-- react-empty: 177 --><div class="Paragraph ls-t-a-j" data-reactid="178"><p>Live action alternatives to successful anime doesn't always work when it comes to Japanese cinema, especially in recent years.
