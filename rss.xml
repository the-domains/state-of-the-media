            <title><![CDATA[The Fisher King (1991)]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Fisher King (1991)</h1><p>It's odd trying not to admit that a 23 year old film has become dated. It was 1991, and the world wasn't sure what the 90's would be yet. Tape records, a heavy focus on the radio and newspapers, and a soundtrack that certainly plucks a little harder at the minds distant memories than one would like to admit, all stand together to make it clear, you are watching an old film of yester year and times have changed. It's interesting then, when originality can flow so easily and readily from a Hollywood piece. Robin Williams and Jeff Bridges are both well-established actors by this time, and it's hardly Terry Gilliam's first film. But you can't imagine a more appropriately cast and well thought through alternative romp. </p></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Whiplash - 2014]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Whiplash - 2014</h1><p>A film about Jazz doesn't jump to the top of many people's lists of must see films. But that overwhelming focus on perfection, both in expectation and personal desire, translates across any medium, whether music, sportsmanship or almost anything else. There's more than a sense of a drill sergeant from Simmons's character - Fletcher - as he barks out obscenities and attacks each member of his band. His, is definitely the stand out performance, with an incredible range of anger on show from patient frustration (during a first time practice) through to bombastic rage in a matter of moments... Simmons never misses a beat.</p></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Steve Jobs (2015)]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>As time marches on, the meaning and value of Steve Jobs continues to shift. Now part of legend, popular culture has started to echo the back lash against Steve for headlining the credits of multiple devices - that owed more to those around him than Jobs himself. All the while, main stream media continues to try to digest this realist view of the man, along with the IT rock star image that it built around him. Though harder to make a visual connection between Steve and Fassbender, this latest effort, is undoubtedly a more successful film than the other recent namesake "Jobs" 2013. In fact, that lack of "cosmetic puppetry" assists the film's earnestness as a character piece - questioning motive and art all the while... But let's return to the nuts and bolts of the movie.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Witch (2015)</h1><p>I find jump scares scary. But I don't find them fun. Well done everyone, you got me! The intense orchestra, the clever editing and the make-up / cgi department all came together, and I got scared...
