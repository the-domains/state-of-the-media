the first episode offers you the chance to reminisce over who you met, what you've been doing, and it does so with a subtle flourish of visual artistry that has been there, bubbling just under the surface, throughout the gameplay. It was only at this moment, that I was able to take it as a hyper reality piece, as much a product of an American ___ or the UK's Grange Hill as it is the modern gaming industry. And at this point I found the respect for the game I had previously been lacking.</p><p>A pet hate of mine in current pop culture is for it to be needlessly self-referential. It's up there with the "I love it when the action moves to China" moment of Hollywood films currently. When it's done well, its fantastically entertaining and (or) deeply meaningful. Passing the fictional universe under the mirror of reality we have pieced together from other films, games or texts from myriad genres.Personal favourites of the technique in would be No More Heroes, The Wrestler, or Mansun's Six. These are (respectively) a game a film and an album that all build something new out of placing themselves in their medium through direct reference and toying with the entertainment forms tropes and conventions. Tarentino and GTA do the same in a (deliberately) ham fisted manner, that speaks well to a larger audiences, and means we can all enjoy the "pop culture" references.</p><p>Unfortunately, the latter have been copied to the point of parody, and Life is Strange is replete with these moments where artistry only seems available through direct reference. You follow / lead Max. She's a photographer. You are told she is a photographer by her teacher, her monologue, her childhood friends, her rivals, the nerds and bullies, and most loudly of all, by the game makers torrents of references. Its no Wikipedia first liner for photography though, with Jon Lennon making his way into the list of inspiring quotes. Only occasionally did it feel like the voice artists chewed their lines though, which is where this (redeeming) hyper reality vibe kicks in.</p><picture>

<p>It is very teen youth orientated, but not with that demography as a target audience, nor are they the subject to a fly on the wall for an older generation… instead its using that world as a back drop for its narrative, characters and interactions. If Arcade Fire's "The Suburbs" were a game, I reckon Life is Strange wouldn't be a bad fit. The added tools and story devices that arise from game play are then worked in well, especially for talking through the decisions you are making with afriend as you play together. Its got a massive one up from Walking Dead and Tell Tale in that regard, where each decision is a new opportunity for regret and face palming.</p><p>So I'd advise stretching your taste barometer for the first episode and seeing where you're left after its buttery climax. My mind was made up within 20 minutes that I was disappointed, and then won over again very firmly. There's enough here to suggest a compelling experience is brewing, but its hidden by the overtures of trying to flavour the story with artistic statements which - unfortunately - might detract from the greater experience for some. Also, there's some of the best friend zoning in any experience ever. Ouch.</p><h2>Mid Season</h2><p>That was hella crazy. I'd heard people raving about episode three, being something special, which (unfairly) caused me to watch the whole episode loaded with expectation of something revolutionary around every corner. But in reality, the game plays to its structure and offers more of a crescendo of elements coming together with character drama and a sense of responsibility to your actions that you may not have been expecting to feel.</p><picture>

<p>Here then is where Life is Strange plays its master stroke. Or at the very least, where it shows a real awareness of what the gameplay and narrative have been achieving together. Its no mystery or spoiler to reveal Max's time traveling, and she's far from the first character to meet the complexities and dangers of changing events in the past. However, by controlling her, we are given the luxury of choosing what outcomes we prefer from our characters. We're not entirely bound by the games logic structure, and its need to push us to one of its inevitable conclusions. Alone, this is empowering, and makes each choice slightly more of a feature, as we debate how it may effect things down the road, having peeked down either side of the fork for a moment.</p><p>And all the while, that college theme is brewing away with its photographs and poets, and that central protagonist having returned home after a long journey… it does its best to stir those feelings of nostalgia and loss all at once.</p><h2>Looking Back</h2><p>The series is masterfully executed and falls just short of perfection due to a <em>slightly </em>biased ending which loses the surefootedness the series had expressed before. It certainly doesn’t stop the rest of the game from being stellar, but if you chose to see every ending, there is certainly one that is "The " ending.</p><picture>

<p>There's also a definite stretching of the episodic nature of Life is Strange in the final two episodes 2, as they fill out in length. Indeed, the amount that is covered in episode 4 almost necessitates a 6th episode to give a little more balance. Largely though, that emotive reaction to the end of the 1st episode only grows over the course of the story, and the characters, environments and plot grow more compelling as time advances. Do we need to revisit Max's world again? No, I don't think so.
