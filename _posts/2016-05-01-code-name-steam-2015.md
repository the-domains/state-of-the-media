# Code Name: STEAM ([2015][0])

As is a tendency of anyone when attempting to describe a videogame, and to give it life through words, we tend to make parallels. The pedigree behind STEAM includes Advance Wars and Fire Emblem, and the chessboard like structure to the strategy world clearly mirrors that heritage. In addition, we have a heavy dose of Valkyria Chronicles, both in terms of hypothetically historic settings and those glorious cell shaded visuals that help the titles sing, rendered in a reality of their own making. But there's more. Your foes are a set of aliens and your weapons and the worlds are powered by some kind of elaborate Steampunk (hence the name) and the story bubbles along like an exaggerated 60s American comic.

So, with that muddle of gameplay ideas, you start to get an inkling of the kind of game we have here. Heavily leaning on the tight strategic gameplay, these myriadinspirations don't feel as unruly as may have been the case from a less talented team. The tight levels are littered with collectable items for unlocking new equipment and perks for your character. Your arsenal is rapidly expanded to give you an expanding set of options to approach each challenge. Enemy types are also switched up regularly, meaning you're often being asked to find solutions and tactics that work in each instance. There's certainly some weapons and characters you lean on more than others, and the special moves (available once for each sortie, but requiring no "action points" to work) but the balance of your team is of utmost importance. Keeping the squad tightly arranged while making gambles on progress against care is filled with satisfaction, and after an unduly steep learning curve replete with deaths, I was soon seeing this as more well balanced than the first hours suggest.

Another generous touch comes across in character control. Rather than planning a move across the grid to collect some coins on the characters allotted turn, you can stride along the map to the edge of your movement range, and then return to your starting point with no repercussions. The exception to this rule is where you fire a weapon or take damage, meaning planning is still encouraged.

When I think of Steam alongside its peers, I keep returning to X Com. Although the cover and accuracy systems are not rendered so formulaically for you, they are here. But the biggest difference is the lack of map. There's a strict 3rd person view pointthroughout, meaning you will frequently switch characters to keep abreast of how best to manoeuvre the team around the stages.

Clearly, as with any strategy title, STEAM won't be to everyone's taste. But for those it does manage to capture, you'll be won over in mind and heart.
