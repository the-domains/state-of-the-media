# The Witch (2015)
![](https://thefilmqueuedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/the-witch-movie-2016-film-wallpaper-hd-exclusive-goat.jpg)

I find jump scares scary. But I don't find them fun. Well done everyone, you got me! The intense orchestra, the clever editing and the make-up / cgi department all came together, and I got _scared_... Round of applause

Maybe I shouldn't be too critical, as there's definitely an art to it. My issue is that the art is easily lost by loud noises and a big bag of repetitive tricks. Winning attention through fear is almost a dead cert. That's how the news works too. But making something universally beautiful and poetic is tough. Genre defining pieces like Alien walk the line well of building atmosphere alongside a cohesive world, rather than just exploiting existing audience fears. The Witch too, falls into this thoughtful category. And it has more than a few tricks up its sleeve.

More often than not providing a framing of the action, situation and soundtrack that almost scream out for jump scares and horror, it can easily seem much like any other regular horror cinema fodder. But elements like the old English use of "thee" and "thou art" put it as a little off kilter. And while the isolation of our family in the woods is a classic horror setup, the ambiguous villain makes it far harder to read. At times, it feels like nature, and the struggles of life in an old land are the only real forces at work.

Folklore and religion are blended together here as another pair of opposing forces, explored in the same scenes. Certain actions and justifications (especially those of the adults) draw out modern day questions and considerations. But the older children, wrestling with their approach to adulthood, are our real protagonists.

I don't want to give too much away, which is testament to the fact the film is worth watching, even for those like me who are normally uncomfortable with horror. But I can't hand on heart praise The Witch unreservedly, as there are moments that feel contrived and conventional along the way.

It Follows (2014) manages to feel like a love letter to horror that also opens up the genre and explores it. It's a modern day classic through and through, bringing elements of dozens of films to a new audience, along with acompelling narrative for old hats at the genre. I can't claim that the Witch is aiming for such grandiose proclamations, ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/721c143c-2ff6-4974-8c1e-bbd11d706c79.jpg)
