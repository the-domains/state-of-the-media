# Firewatch ([2016][0])

We first started hearing about Firewatch a couple of years back, and while some of the heritage of Campo studio is familiar (Staff worked, Bioshock 2, The Walking Dead and Ninja Blade), this is their first title as a new studio. It shouldn't be surprising to hear, that as a high-er profile Indie title, there's a PS4 version and the game is built with Unity. Undoubtedly, the visuals sing brighter than many Unity games achieve (Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak looked very "Unity", perhaps because comparison with its brother and sister are easy), with a colour palette that makes the world shine with strong bright colours, crisp shadows and warm light. As the sun shifts across the landscape, while mist traces along a cold creek in the early morning, there's much to celebrate in the game art, and nature itself.

* The colour palette is alluringly super real. It serves the game and experience as a whole very well.

A lot of action and character motivation frame themselves around this connection with nature. The whole premise of the game (working the summer in a firewatch tower) screams of some kind of urban rejection.Of course, that rejection isn't human though. Throughout, your time in the woods, cliffs and creeks of Wyoming, there is frequent conversation with Deliah - your narrative boss, and gameplay guide - ensuring isolation isn't total for either the player or Henry.

* If there were ever a game to deserve a graphic novel... So many images get packed with meaning as you play through.

To discuss the twists and turns would be enough to ruin some of them, and at only a handful of hours in length, its certainly worth picking up.I will say though, that the greatest pleasures come from the agency that Henry gives. You're never playing "yourself" per se, but there is opportunity to shape and mould the Henry you think you are controlling, and for him to guess at the goings on of the story around him. 

Currently, if you have the PC for it and you've enjoyed adventure games of the past with branching narratives, Firewatch is a great one to pick up. For PS4 owners a patch is needed to get the framerate & object popping more consistent. _(this was [released][1] and hopefully expanded on since February)._

Mild release issues aside, however you play it or played Firewatch, its a fantastic reminder that Indie studios are going to carry on pushing the narrative potential of our interactive medium no matter what. And to do so with such visual aplomb is even more sensational.
