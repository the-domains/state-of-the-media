# Whiplash - [2014][0]

A film about Jazz doesn't jump to the top of many people's lists of must see films. But that overwhelming focus on perfection, both in expectation and personal desire, translates across any medium, whether music, sportsmanship or almost anything else. There's more than a sense of a drill sergeant from [Simmons][1]'s character - Fletcher - as he barks out obscenities and attacks each member of his band. His, is definitely the stand out performance, with an incredible range of anger on show from patient frustration (during a first time practice) through to bombastic rage in a matter of moments... Simmons never misses a beat.

* I'm no mystic, but if this doesn't fill you with dread, you haven't watched Whiplash.

Clearly a talented musician in his own right, Miles Teller has a slightly more conventional character arc as we journey with him towards becoming a legend. He'd also intensely dislikeable at times, reflecting that anger onto those around him, or displaying intense arrogance. The pair together though make a fantastic setup on screen throughout. And expert editing and cinematography are married in a way that truly makes the music sing. Its visually and aurally marvellous, with the frequently reused locations and sets still capable of throwing up surprises across the running time.

In search of a criticism, I'd say that the film loses its grip on a believable, real world drama at times. And not in a descent into the fantastical - as I am often in favour of when executed well -- but in terms of being a little hysterical and far fetched. But Whiplash unites around its central, driving concepts well and builds itself to a great conclusion.

A theatre-like character study that can stand proudly alongside the likes of Birdman, Whiplash delivers a great musical experience that speaks especially well to creative individuals with designs on grandeur.
