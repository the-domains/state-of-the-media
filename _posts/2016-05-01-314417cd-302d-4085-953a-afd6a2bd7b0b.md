# Parasite I & II ([2014][0], 2015)

Live action alternatives to successful anime doesn't always work when it comes to Japanese cinema, especially in recent years. But there are exceptions to prove the rule... or something.

To be fair, it's a fair criticism of modern blockbusters and Hollywood as a whole -cashing out on tried and tested, repetitive concepts, while choosing to invest in known franchises is the norm... But I digress. What is Parasyte and why does it deserve our time?

Preying on the concept of man eroding the earth to the point of no return, "Parasite" creates an original new enemy that sits half way between a zombie and the kind of alien we're used to seeing in John Carpenter films (I'm looking at you "The Thing" - 1982). And they are genuinely terrifying. Consuming the hosts entire neck and head, they maintain a human, expressionless form while learning of the world and human culture in a mechanical / insect like manner, remaining emotionless Zeitgeist of former family members. In the manga, they would then deform horrifically. A face would peel back into a long whip (similar to the possessed gonados of Resident Evil 4 - 2005), or open out like a Venus Flytrap. Then bloody disembowelment normally ensues.

This was translated wonderfully into the anime, and it felt like a real addition to see the fluidity of movement and the transitions of forms. And it's a pleasant surprise to admit that even for series veterans, the transition is fantastically pleasing in live action too. Through a mixture of performance and pleasantly stylised CGI, there's a great mix of the anime's look and the realism of live-action. The parasites also do something that villains don't often do, and that's develop alongside the hero. Almost exponentially.

Whether you're watching the anime or the film, there's no concept introduced over the entirety of the runtime that isn't unfathomable with the information you receive in the first 15 minutes or so. That's not a criticism on the narrative being trite, far from it. The internal logic of the series (when it comes to the parasite's themselves) is engaging because its believable, and somewhat logical. We're rarely asked to suspend disbelief more than beyond those first few moments require.

So the "meat"of the series remains intact, and the transition to live action isn't a sticking point. But, even with a pair of films, there is a lot of editing of key characters and plot points. Its undoubtedly best to watch Parasite through the anime (or to read the manga) if you're happy with either of those mediums. For anyone who needs live action actors, and for existing fans, Parasite is a great realisation of a series keen to blend horror, morality, nature and society into a gripping and compelling story. Much like the namesake, this one will get under your skin, and stay there.
