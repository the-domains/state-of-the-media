# Ant-Man ([2015][0])

It is interesting, seeing a film and getting the feeling it wasn't meant to be. Not in terms of its quality or a stroke of luck from fate. With Ant-Man, we have a full on mockery of every super hero trope there is, wrapped in the narrative of a classic comic book film. From the outset, let's be clear and highlight that the film pulls plenty of punches. Especially early on, this is ticking a list of check boxes with almost indifference. We meet the hero (Stan) and meet his family, finding both his opportunity for redemption and his reason to fight the powers of evil... or rather to rob the rich. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/641896a6-81ec-467e-977a-0b6184349415.jpg)

But Edgar Wright's script is bubbling under the surface, and there are some sequences with rapid monologues and snappy editing that feel like they're floating out of those VHS box sets of spaced sitting on the shelf. And the films genuinely entertaining blend of comedy minor tragedy and full blown "bad ass" -ery that it squeezes into the many CG and action sequences is pleasantly convincing and memorable for all the right reasons.

But strangely, they're not Edgar's. He never got to direct Ant-Man after a falling out with the studio. I found myself debating my emotional state in Edgar's shoes, watching the finished film. As an outsider looking in, its safe to say they got so much right. But how far did Edgar want to take it, and how far did he try to push it to get pulled from production? The book shelf romance isn't something Edgar has avoided in his other films (likely Scott Pilgrims most unbridled change to the source material) and maybe that generic hero build up was an inevitability. I can't escape a sense that there's a kernel of themes and knot tying that's missing here though.

Combat involving Thomas the tank engine made it to the big screen, but there's a hollow narrative centre here. One dramatic scene feels to take us in the direction of Interstellar or 2001, but even this is cheapened and snapped away. So if I were Edgar, my Tweet would look like:My best chance yet, but Hollywood wins out with sugar coating. Still... the No.1 Marvel film.
