As time marches on, the meaning and value of Steve Jobs continues to shift. Now part of legend, popular culture has started to echo the back lash against Steve for headlining the credits of multiple devices - that owed more to those around him than Jobs himself. All the while, main stream media continues to try to digest this realist view of the man, along with the IT rock star image that it built around him. Though harder to make a visual connection between Steve and Fassbender, this latest effort, is undoubtedly a more successful film than the other recent namesake "Jobs" 2013\. In fact, that lack of "cosmetic puppetry" assists the film's earnestness as a character piece - questioning motive and art all the while... But let's return to the nuts and bolts of the movie.

Focused around the dramatization of the half hour before three key conferences, my partner noted the film plays out like a theatre piece in many ways. The back stage iconography, immaculate presentation of period dress and (most importantly) a keen focus on human interaction as dialogue exchanges all serves to further reinforce the stage script interpretation. But to me, Danny Boyle's treatment of time and editing (almost the only detail to strongly suggest his presence in the production) sell the latest feature as a motion picture in its own right, rather than as an extension to the man's biography.

The audience aren't sheltered from the Hyperbole of Steve, with classic lines making their way to the final cut, including computers as "bicycles for the mind" and the (half amusing, half character positioning) recurring exchange - "Computers aren't art", "F\*\*k you". But we're constantly asked to question Steve's actions as we see failure loom and get washed away by Michael Fassbender's exceptional depiction of unfathomable bravado and bluster. It certainly isn't a flattering view on him then... It can get deeply uncomfortable to witness some of the heated exchanges and arguments throughout, which pays testament to the quality of acting throughout.

Rather than seeking to explain success or accurately documenting the past, we're often asking wider questions of people and collaboration in general. What does motivation cost? How does history repeat itself? Is a greater purpose noble? Often and especially in the first vignette, there is little causality offered to the brazen and hurtful actions on show. Gradually, as the layers of time develop, there is justification laid out for us to consider, but the counter point is always more prevalent: "Its not binary. Being decent and successful".

In dramatic terms, Jobs is certainly the only one who can sustain the miasma that swirls unrelentingly around him. On Occasion (and again, in the opening most so) its hard to buy into this sensational series of events, and Boyle seems to make an ill aimed reach for the style of Birdman, rolling up decades rather than days. But with the strange context of the media sound bites and advertising campaigns, it begins to make sense as a stylistic choice. One foot in reality, and the other planted in media circus fantasy, it's a tough line to walk, no less so as our guide is deliberately dislikeable in a way that Michael Keaton (Riggen) could avoid through his fantasy duel personality elements.

Despite her low screen time in comparison to many of the cast, its perhaps Lisa who provides Jobs his greatest highs and lows. Written into the narrative as a version of himself (intelligent, capable, seemingly unwanted by a natural parent) Lisa casts the darkest shadow over Jobs' selfish actions. She is also the only character capable of redeeming him, and we spend a great deal of time vilifying his actions when he fails to seize frequent opportunities to save himself through his charming daughter. Ultimately as he grows older, so too do those distances with many of his peers... In the end, the final tone is often what people take away with them, and with Steve Jobs, this is likely to disappoint as many as it pleases after investing so much into the character study that came before.
