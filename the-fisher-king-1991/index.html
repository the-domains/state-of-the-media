<p>There's the sprinkling of swearing and violence that stops The Fisher King from being a family movie… and the pace is completely off, throwing out the "age rating to draw a crowd". Both are conscious decisions that Hollywood would be loath to make with a cast of such prestigious billing anytime since and - while it would be foolhardy to suggest that the results are a resoundingly coherent accomplishment - there's a charm that pulls you in more effectively than an MTV rate of editing is normally able to. Gilliam makes himself known, with his off kilter cinematography, as it swirls and bobs over people's faces, making wonderfully off putting representations of the alcohol ailed mind. There's plenty of flavour, regardless if it is to everyone's taste.</p><p>There's undoubtedlya loose and unrefined feel to the final cut, perhaps hinting that the film seriously struggled to scale down from a behemoth of an initial run time. And there's a host of characters (mostly the homeless friends of Robin Williams) who miss out on any closure. Evidently, this undermines the admittedly sugar coated message of beauty residing in any cast of society, by treating those who lack particular meaning to protagonist Jack with any great concern or consistency.</p><p>There may be something of a rainman message of tolerance and shared learning in here then, but the gems are a little too rough cut to recommend with unbridled earnest. Still, there's great performances from favourites and unknowns alike, and an alluringly rickety plot that certainly couldn't have been put together in the 21st century. </p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-black colors-global " data-reactid="31"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="32"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="33"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="34"><span data-reactid="35"><!-- react-empty: 36 --><h2 data-reactid="37"><a data-reactid="38">State of the Media</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="39"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="40"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="41"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="42"></div></section></div></div>
